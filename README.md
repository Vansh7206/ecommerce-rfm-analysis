# 📊 AI-Powered E-Commerce Business Intelligence System

An end-to-end Business Intelligence system combining SQL analytics, RFM customer segmentation, and a natural language query engine built with Streamlit. Transforms raw e-commerce data into executive-level insights — no SQL required.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project analyzes a large-scale Brazilian e-commerce dataset to surface actionable business intelligence across revenue, operations, customer behavior, and geography. It pairs traditional data analysis with a lightweight AI intent engine to simulate a conversational BI assistant.

**Dataset:** [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

## 🧠 AI Query Engine

Ask business questions in plain English — no SQL needed.

**Example queries:**
- `"Total revenue"`
- `"Top 5 states by revenue"`
- `"Revenue by customer segment"`
- `"Orders by payment type"`
- `"Average order value"`

**How it works:**

| Step | Component | What it does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | `ai_query_engine.py` | Parses intent — extracts metric, dimension, aggregation type, and Top-N conditions |
| 2 | `analytics_engine.py` | Executes aggregation, grouping, and sorting via Pandas |
| 3 | `ai_explainer.py` | Generates human-readable insights and highlights key patterns |

## 📊 Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Customers | 96,000+ |
| Orders | 99,000+ |
| Total Revenue | R$15.8M |
| Delivery Success Rate | 97% |

**Headline findings:**
- Revenue scaled consistently from 2016–2018
- Mass-market model with low average order value
- Revenue heavily concentrated in São Paulo
- Strong delivery reliability, but slow delivery speed
- Majority of customers purchase only once

---

## 👥 RFM Customer Segmentation

Customers are scored on **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** value and grouped into four segments:

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Champion | Recent, frequent, high-spend |
| Loyal | Consistent buyers, strong LTV |
| Regular | Moderate engagement |
| Lost | Inactive, low engagement |

**Key finding:** Loyal customers drive the majority of revenue, yet most customers purchase only once — making retention the single largest growth lever.

## ✅ Supported Capabilities

- Revenue, order count, and AOV aggregation
- Group-by analysis (state, category, payment type)
- Top-N queries
- AI-generated result explanations
- Modular, extensible backend architecture

## ❌ Current Limitations

- No month/year-based filtering (e.g. "Monthly revenue in 2018")
- No time-series trend detection or YoY comparisons
- No multi-condition queries
- Rule-based intent engine — not an LLM
